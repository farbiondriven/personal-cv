\begin{cvletter}
I am pleased to be applying for this Engineer Team Leader position as I believe
that I possess everything necessary to execute the role and all associated duties successfully.

My name is Fabio Battaglia and I am a dedicated and passionate engineer with a strong determination
to build innovative products and services. I strongly believe that all complex goals are reachable
with good design and constructive team work. Currently I'm working as an Engineer team lead at Remark AI UK,
building AI pipelines for real time image analysis. With my team we built a IOT and cloud infrastructure
to get analytic results from video stream and structure the data in a cloud server, using mostly
Python and C++. I'm in charge of
the architecture and managing the tasks between the team, while still developing some functionalities.

I graduated with a master's degree in Automation Engineering and Robotics and a bachelor degree
in Software Engineering cum laude at the University of Catania, Italy.
I have direct experience with all applications and coding languages required in the job description,
I believe that I am an ideal candidate for the position not just for the technical side, but because I feel
I can contribute to the team spirit and culture.
Finally, I have attached my up-to-date CV for your review so please do not hesitate to contact me
if you have any questions on my career history.


Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to speaking with you in the near future.
